# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continuously striving to deepen my understanding of programming concepts and enhance my skills in C++. This project is a culmination of my efforts to create a dynamic combat system, showcasing my ability to implement various aspects of game design and logic using C++.

The software I have developed is a text-based combat simulation, allowing two characters to engage in combat using defined attack and defense mechanics. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the language's syntax, object-oriented programming principles, and the use of data structures to manage game state effectively.

I aim to build a foundation for more complex game systems, exploring areas such as skill leveling, character progression, and combat mechanics in greater depth. The experience I gain from this project will serve as a stepping stone for future endeavors in game development.

You can watch a demonstration of the software in action, along with a walkthrough of the code, in this video:

# Development Environment

- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
- **Language:** C++
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `<string>`: For string manipulation and management.
  - `<unordered_map>`: For storing and retrieving attack and defense moves efficiently.
  - `<utility>`: To utilize pairs for storing related data.
  - `<iostream>`: For handling input and output operations.
  - `<vector>`: For vectory goodness.

# Useful Websites

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/): An accessible tutorial site for learning C++ basics and syntax.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com): A valuable resource for troubleshooting coding issues and seeking community support.

# Future Work

Although I made significant progress, I was unable to implement all the features I had envisioned for this project due to time constraints. I will continue to refine and expand upon my work, focusing on the following key improvements:

- Incorporate skills and skill leveling to enhance character development.
- Implement functioning level-ups to provide a sense of progression and reward.
- Enhance the combat logic to make it more robust, allowing for a more engaging gameplay experience.

This project has been an invaluable learning experience, and I am eager to apply the insights gained as I move forward in my software development journey.
